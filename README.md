rttp
====

A small Rust HTTP workspace with a client crate (`rttp_client`) and a wrapper
crate (`rttp`) that also provides a minimal blocking HTTP server.

## Client

`rttp_client` supports plain HTTP by default. Optional features add async
request APIs and TLS implementations:

| name | comment |
|------|---------|
| async | Async request APIs |
| tls-native | HTTPS with `native-tls` |
| tls-rustls | HTTPS with `rustls` |

```toml
[dependencies]
rttp_client = "0.2"
```

Direct TCP client connections are opened with `socket2`. SOCKS proxy handshakes
are still delegated to the `socks` crate.

```rust,no_run
use rttp_client::HttpClient;

let response = HttpClient::new()
  .get()
  .url("http://127.0.0.1:8080/health")
  .emit()?;
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

## Server

The `rttp` crate exposes `rttp::Http::server`, which creates a blocking
`HttpServer` listener.

```toml
[dependencies]
rttp = "0.2"
```

```rust,no_run
use rttp::server::HttpResponse;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
  let server = rttp::Http::server("127.0.0.1:0")?;
  println!("listening on {}", server.local_addr()?);

  server.accept_one(|request| {
    println!("{} {}", request.method(), request.target());
    HttpResponse::ok("hello")
  })
}
```

Use `HttpServer::bind` directly when you already want the server type,
`HttpServer::local_addr` to read the bound address, `accept_one` for one
connection, and `serve_requests` for a fixed number of sequential connections.
The listener path uses `socket2`.

The server is intentionally small: it handles blocking HTTP/1.x request parsing
for local tests and simple embedded use, closes each connection after one
response, and does not implement chunked request bodies, keep-alive serving, TLS,
or async accept loops.
