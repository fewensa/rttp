rttp
====

`rttp` wraps `rttp_client` behind optional client features and provides a small
blocking HTTP server for local tests and simple embedded use.

## Server

Create a listener with `rttp::Http::server` or call `HttpServer::bind` directly.
The server listener is built with `socket2`.

```rust,no_run
use std::time::Duration;

use rttp::server::HttpResponse;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
  let server = rttp::Http::server("127.0.0.1:0")?
    .with_read_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(5)))
    .with_write_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(5)));
  println!("listening on {}", server.local_addr()?);

  server.accept_one(|request| {
    println!("{} {}", request.method(), request.target());
    HttpResponse::ok("hello").header("Transfer-Encoding", "chunked")
  })
}
```

`HttpServer::local_addr` returns the bound address, which is useful when binding
to port `0` in tests. `HttpServer::accept_one` serves one connection.
`HttpServer::serve_requests` serves a fixed number of sequential connections on
the same listener. `HttpServer::with_read_timeout` and
`HttpServer::with_write_timeout` apply socket-level timeouts to each accepted
connection; pass `None` to leave the corresponding socket timeout unset.

Add `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` to an `HttpResponse` to write the complete
response body with chunked transfer framing instead of an automatic
`Content-Length`.

The server currently parses blocking HTTP/1.x requests for local tests and
simple embedded use. It supports fixed `Content-Length` and chunked request
bodies, preserves chunked request trailers on `Request`, bounds request
head/body parsing, handles `HEAD` without writing a response body, honors
`Connection` close/keep-alive semantics across a bounded `serve_requests` loop,
writes response body framing consistently, and accepts `Expect: 100-continue`.

The server is intentionally not a full RFC-covering web server and still does
not implement server TLS or async accept loops.

## Client feature

Enable the `client` feature to access `rttp::Http::client`, or enable `async`,
`tls-native`, `tls-rustls`, or `all` for the corresponding `rttp_client`
capabilities.

Direct TCP client connections use `socket2`. SOCKS proxy handshakes remain
delegated to the `socks` crate.
