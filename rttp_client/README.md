rttp_client
===========

`rttp_client` is a small HTTP client crate. Plain HTTP is available by default;
optional features add async request APIs and TLS implementations.

| name | comment |
|------|---------|
| async | Async request APIs |
| http2 | Prior-knowledge h2c over direct `socket2` TCP connections |
| tls-native | HTTPS with `native-tls` |
| tls-rustls | HTTPS with `rustls` |

```toml
[dependencies]
rttp_client = "0.2"
```

```toml
[dependencies]
rttp_client = { version = "0.2", features = ["async", "tls-rustls"] }
```

Direct TCP connections use `socket2`. SOCKS proxy handshakes remain delegated to
the `socks` crate.
HTTP/1.x chunked responses are decoded, and response trailers are exposed
through `Response::trailers`, `Response::trailer`, and
`Response::trailer_value` for both blocking and async request APIs.
With the `http2` feature enabled, `emit_http2_prior_knowledge` sends a minimal
prior-knowledge h2c request over a direct socket2 TCP connection. Non-empty
buffered request bodies are sent as DATA frames, HPACK static Huffman strings
and large header blocks are supported, repeated request header and trailer
fields can use HPACK dynamic entries within the peer's advertised table size,
and incoming dynamic table entries, table-size updates, padded HEADERS, DATA,
and trailer frames are decoded without exposing padding bytes. TLS ALPN, proxy
tunneling, proxy h2, and full HTTP/2 features such as general multiplexing and
priority scheduling are not part of that client path.

## Examples

```rust,no_run
use rttp_client::HttpClient;

let response = HttpClient::new()
  .get()
  .url("http://127.0.0.1:8080/health")
  .emit()?;
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

```rust,no_run
use rttp_client::HttpClient;
use rttp_client::types::Proxy;

let response = HttpClient::new()
  .post()
  .url("http://127.0.0.1:8080/messages")
  .content_type("application/json")
  .raw(r#"{"from":"rttp"}"#)
  .proxy(Proxy::http("127.0.0.1", 1081))
  .emit()?;
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

```rust,no_run
# #[cfg(feature = "async")]
# async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
use rttp_client::HttpClient;

let response = HttpClient::new()
  .get()
  .url("http://127.0.0.1:8080/health")
  .rasync()
  .await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```
