rttp_client
===========

`rttp_client` is a small HTTP client crate. Plain HTTP is available by default;
optional features add async request APIs and TLS implementations.

| name | comment |
|------|---------|
| async | Async request APIs |
| http2 | Bounded prior-knowledge h2c over direct `socket2` TCP connections |
| tls-native | HTTPS with `native-tls` |
| tls-rustls | HTTPS with `rustls` |

```toml
[dependencies]
rttp_client = "0.2"
```

```toml
[dependencies]
rttp_client = { version = "0.2", features = ["async", "tls-rustls"] }
```

Direct TCP connections use `socket2`. SOCKS proxy handshakes remain delegated to
the `socks` crate.
HTTP/1.x chunked responses are decoded, and response trailers are exposed
through `Response::trailers`, `Response::trailer`, and
`Response::trailer_value` for both blocking and async request APIs.

## Tested protocol coverage

| area | tested coverage | limits |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| HTTP/1.1 response parsing | `Content-Length`, chunked transfer coding, chunk extensions, informational responses, bodyless `204`/`304`, duplicate `Set-Cookie`, and framing ambiguity rejection | Not a complete RFC conformance suite |
| HTTP/1.1 request emission | Origin-form requests, absolute-form proxy requests, `CONNECT`, `HEAD`, fixed bodies, streaming chunked uploads, and `Expect: 100-continue` | SOCKS handshakes are delegated to the `socks` crate |
| Upgrade and tunnel handoff | `CONNECT` returns the tunnel socket after a successful `200`; `upgrade()` returns the socket after `101 Switching Protocols` and skips interim `1xx` responses | Upgraded protocols are handed to the caller and are not parsed by `rttp_client` |
| Redirects | Auto-redirect covers 301, 302, 303, 307, and 308 method/body behavior, relative and absolute `Location` resolution, same- and cross-authority header handling, loop detection, and redirect bounds | Redirects are HTTP client behavior, not a browser policy implementation |
| Trailers | Chunked response trailers are exposed for blocking and async APIs; streaming chunked uploads can send declared request trailers | Application metadata trailers such as `X-Trace` are allowed; pseudo-header, connection-specific, routing, authentication/cookie, and framing trailer fields are rejected |
| Prior-knowledge h2c | With `http2`, direct `socket2` h2c sends GET, HEAD, bodyless DELETE, OPTIONS, or TRACE, buffered POST, PUT, or PATCH requests, and opt-in RFC 8441 extended CONNECT request HEADERS via `http2_extended_connect`, opens at most one request stream, advertises `SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH = 0`, advertises `SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL = 1` only for the explicit extended CONNECT path, validates received `SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH` values as only `0` or `1`, honors initial peer `SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` by failing before request HEADERS when the peer allows zero streams, honors peer-advertised `SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE` request metadata limits, accepts only legal `SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` values from 16,384 through 16,777,215 bytes, splits outbound HEADERS, DATA, and trailers to the active peer frame-size limit, rejects oversized inbound frames when a configured local frame-size limit is exceeded, bounds HPACK dynamic table use with `SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE`, strips HTTP/1.x connection-specific request fields before emission, rejects connection-specific peer response fields, suppresses HEAD response bodies, treats `RST_STREAM` on the active stream as a bounded reset/cancellation signal, acknowledges valid PING frames with matching opaque data, DATA bodies, trailers, HPACK static Huffman strings, bounded large header blocks, padded incoming frames, `GOAWAY` shutdown boundaries, PRIORITY metadata validation without scheduling, HTTP/2-allowed unknown/extension frame ignoring inside this bounded path, reserved stream-id high-bit normalization, and conservative DATA flow control | Ordinary `CONNECT`, header-configured `:protocol` metadata, and HTTP/1.1 `Upgrade` handoff requests are rejected deterministically before opening a client socket, and `PUSH_PROMISE`/server push is rejected instead of managed; bounded prior-knowledge h2c only, with no public cancellation callback API, no dynamic policy API, no extension callback API, no full extension negotiation, TLS ALPN, external h2 integration, proxy tunneling to h2, proxy h2, tunnel handoff, connection pooling, persistent HTTP/2 session management, automatic retry, server push, full stream state machine, unbounded multiplex scheduling, general multiplexing, priority scheduling, request bodies or trailers for extended CONNECT, or request bodies for GET, HEAD, DELETE, OPTIONS, or TRACE |

With the `http2` feature enabled, `emit_http2_prior_knowledge` sends a bounded
prior-knowledge h2c request over a direct socket2 TCP connection. It opens at
most one request stream and honors the peer's initial
`SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS`: a value of zero rejects the request before
HEADERS are sent. It also honors the peer's advertised
`SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE` for request metadata: encoded request HEADERS
and trailing HEADERS must stay within that peer boundary before emission, while
peers that do not advertise the setting keep the bounded direct-client default.
It supports GET, HEAD, bodyless DELETE, OPTIONS, or TRACE,
buffered POST, PUT, or PATCH requests, and an explicit
`http2_extended_connect(protocol)` request mode. Non-empty buffered request
bodies are sent as DATA frames for the write methods; GET, HEAD, DELETE,
OPTIONS, TRACE, and extended CONNECT requests with bodies are rejected. HEAD,
bodyless DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE, and extended CONNECT requests do not send
request DATA frames, and any HEAD response DATA frames are consumed without
being exposed as a response body. The client advertises
`SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH = 0` in its initial SETTINGS frame so peers see server
push disabled, and it advertises `SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL = 1` only
when `http2_extended_connect` is used. It validates received
`SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH` values as only `0` or `1`; any other value rejects the
bounded h2c handshake.
The client validates `SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` boundaries on both sides of the
bounded h2c handshake. A configured local `http2_max_frame_size` is advertised
only when set, must be in the legal HTTP/2 range of 16,384 through 16,777,215
bytes, and is used to reject inbound frame payloads larger than that active
local limit. Peer-advertised `SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` values outside that
same legal range reject the handshake. Legal peer values become the outbound
frame boundary, so request HEADERS, DATA, and trailing HEADERS are split into
frames no larger than the active peer limit while the client remains a
single-stream prior-knowledge path. Before encoding
request HEADERS, this bounded h2c path strips
HTTP/1.x connection-specific fields: `Connection`, `Keep-Alive`,
`Proxy-Connection`, `Transfer-Encoding`, `Upgrade`, `TE`, `Trailer`, `Host`,
and any field named by a `Connection` token. Peer response HEADERS are rejected
when they contain `Connection`, `Keep-Alive`, `Proxy-Connection`, `TE`,
`Transfer-Encoding`, or `Upgrade`. Application request trailers such as
`X-Trace`, `X-Upload-Status`, or `X-Upload-Checksum` are valid in this bounded
h2c path and are encoded as trailing HEADERS after request DATA. Configured
request trailers are rejected before emission when their field name is invalid
or reserved for connection/framing/routing behavior: `Connection`,
`Keep-Alive`, `Proxy-Connection`, `TE`, `Trailer`, `Transfer-Encoding`,
`Upgrade`, `Content-Length`, `Host`, `Proxy-Authenticate`, or
`Proxy-Authorization`. Peer response trailers use the existing
forbidden-trailer validation for invalid pseudo-header-like names,
connection-specific, routing, authentication/cookie, and framing fields such
as `Authorization`, `Connection`, `Content-Length`, `Cookie`, `Host`,
`Keep-Alive`, `Proxy-Authenticate`, `Proxy-Authorization`,
`Proxy-Connection`, `Set-Cookie`, `TE`, `Trailer`, `Transfer-Encoding`,
`Upgrade`, and `WWW-Authenticate`.
HPACK static Huffman strings and bounded large header
blocks are supported, repeated request header and trailer fields can use HPACK
dynamic entries within the peer's advertised `SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE`.
When the peer omits the setting, the request encoder uses the 4,096-byte HPACK
default. When the peer advertises zero, request dynamic indexing is disabled
and request HEADERS and trailers are literal encoded. Peer values above 4,096
bytes are valid, but RTTP caps request dynamic indexing at its 4,096-byte
bounded encoder size. Incoming response
HEADERS and trailers are decoded with the locally advertised
`SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE`: the default is 4,096 bytes unless
`ConfigBuilder::http2_header_table_size` configures another value that fits in
`u32`. Incoming dynamic table size updates may shrink that decoder table,
including to zero, but updates above the local advertised limit are rejected.
These HPACK table limits do not change request metadata list-size enforcement,
response trailer validation, body framing, DATA flow control, or the
single-stream h2c policy. Valid response PRIORITY frames and
HEADERS priority fields are validated and ignored as metadata; malformed
priority metadata is rejected, and no priority scheduling is performed. Valid
PING frames are acknowledged with PING ACK frames that carry the same opaque
8-byte data.
Unknown frame types, including extension frames, are ignored only after the
prior-knowledge h2c handshake in this bounded direct-client path where HTTP/2
permits that behavior; RTTP does not expose extension callbacks or perform
full extension negotiation. Reserved stream identifier high bits are masked
when frames are parsed or written, which normalizes wire framing but does not
add broader multiplex scheduling or persistent session management.
Server push is outside this bounded client path even when a peer advertises
`SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH = 1`: incoming `PUSH_PROMISE` frames are rejected
deterministically instead of creating or tracking push state.
HTTP/1.1 `CONNECT` tunnel handoff remains a separate client path;
prior-knowledge h2c `GOAWAY` is treated as a bounded shutdown signal:
completed responses remain usable, active responses continue only when the
peer's `last-stream-id` includes the stream, and lower boundaries reject the
response deterministically. A `GOAWAY` received before stream 1 is opened is
treated as request refusal and no request HEADERS are sent. RTTP returns that
refusal to the caller instead of retrying on a new connection; callers that
know a request is safe or idempotent must choose any retry policy themselves.
This protocol shutdown boundary is distinct from a transport-level
disconnect, read timeout, write timeout, or TCP reset, which is reported
through the normal socket/error path without an HTTP/2 `last-stream-id`
boundary. `RST_STREAM` is likewise bounded to this
prior-knowledge h2c client path: a reset for the active stream is reported as
response cancellation, while malformed reset frames are rejected
deterministically. RTTP does not expose a public cancellation callback API or
retry the request automatically. Ordinary `CONNECT`, header-configured RFC
8441 `:protocol` metadata, HTTP/1.1 `Upgrade` handoff requests, and proxy
tunneling are rejected before a client socket is opened. The explicit
`http2_extended_connect(protocol)` mode emits `:method CONNECT` with
`:protocol`, `:scheme`, `:authority`, and `:path`, but remains a bounded
single-stream request/response path without request bodies, request trailers,
or upgraded socket handoff. HTTP/1.1 `CONNECT` tunnel handoff and `Upgrade`
remain separate client handoff paths; this h2c path does not provide proxy h2,
tunnel handoff, persistent HTTP/2 sessions, or full RFC 8441 support. TLS
ALPN, extension callback APIs, full extension negotiation, external h2
integration, connection pooling, automatic retry, server push, full stream
state machines, and full HTTP/2 features such as unbounded multiplex
scheduling, general multiplexing, and priority scheduling are not part of that
bounded prior-knowledge client path. RTTP does not expose a dynamic policy API
for changing h2c frame-size or metadata limits at runtime.
